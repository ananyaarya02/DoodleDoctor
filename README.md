# DoodleDoctor
This project utilizes NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SciPy, and Shapely to develop model that refine and regularize hand-drawn doodles represented as coordinate data after recognizing different shapes and applying shape-specific regularization using techniques like Douglas-Peucker, least squares circle fitting, and regular polygon approximation.
